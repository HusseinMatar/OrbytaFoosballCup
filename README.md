	‚Ä¢	Clean, non-intrusive info button in the header opens a modal that explains seed, Buchholz, Swiss logic, and bracket flow.

‚∏ª

Tournament Format

To keep it fair and fast, the app uses Swiss qualifiers followed by single-elimination:
	‚Ä¢	2 teams total ‚Üí Direct Final.
	‚Ä¢	4 or 6 teams ‚Üí Swiss R1 (each team plays once) ‚Üí Top-4 (Semifinals ‚Üí Final).
	‚Ä¢	8+ teams ‚Üí Swiss R1 + Swiss R2 (each team plays twice) ‚Üí Top-8 (Quarters ‚Üí Semis ‚Üí Final).

This ensures:
	‚Ä¢	Everyone plays at least one (often two) matches before elimination
	‚Ä¢	There is always a Final
	‚Ä¢	The bracket feels competitive without being overly long

‚∏ª

How Standings Are Calculated
	‚Ä¢	Seed (testa di serie)
Initial team strength. Computed from the average level of the two players. Lower seed number means stronger on paper (Seed 1 is best). Used to pair Round 1.
	‚Ä¢	Points
Win = 1, Loss = 0.
	‚Ä¢	Buchholz
Sum of the final points of your opponents in the Swiss rounds ‚Äî a measure of schedule strength. If you faced strong teams (who also won), your Buchholz is higher.
	‚Ä¢	Swiss Ranking Order
	1.	Points (desc)
	2.	Buchholz (desc)
	3.	Seed (asc)

The top teams (Top-8 or Top-4, depending on total teams) advance to the knockout stage.

‚∏ª

Security Rules

A good default (requires login to read, and only allowlisted admins to write):

rules_version = '2';

service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{db}/documents {

    function isAdmin() {
      return request.auth != null
        && exists(/databases/$(db)/documents/admins/$(request.auth.uid));
    }

    // Tournament state
    match /foosball/{docId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;  // require login to view
      allow write: if isAdmin();            // only admins can write
    }

    // Admins allowlist
    match /admins/{uid} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;  // optional: or true
      allow write: if isAdmin();            // only an existing admin can modify
    }

    // Optional admin session logs
    match /adminSessions/{id} {
      allow read: if isAdmin();
      allow write: if isAdmin();
    }

    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if false;
    }
  }
}

Usage Guide

As a logged-in user
	‚Ä¢	See the year, Gare iniziali (Swiss), Tabellone, and the Campioni banner when available.
	‚Ä¢	Click the ‚ÑπÔ∏è Come funziona button in the header to read the format rules.

Admin flow (high level)
	1.	Login with Google (must be allowlisted).
	2.	Enter the Admin PIN.
	3.	Paste players in the format Name; Role; Level (role = Attacker/Defender, level 1‚Äì5, roles must be balanced).
	4.	Click Crea squadre to generate balanced teams + Swiss R1.
	5.	In Gare iniziali:
	‚Ä¢	Mark winners for R1.
	‚Ä¢	If 8+ teams, R2 is auto-generated. Mark R2 winners.
	‚Ä¢	The app builds the knockout bracket (Top-8 or Top-4) automatically.
	6.	In Tabellone, click Vince to advance winners through Semifinals and Final.
	7.	Use Salva when desired (auto-saves also on major actions).
Use Reset to start over (keeps the selected year unless you remove that line in code).

‚∏ª

Deployment

Firebase Hosting is recommended:

npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
firebase init hosting
# choose your project, set "public" to the folder where index.html lives
firebase deploy

	‚Ä¢	Make sure your Auth domain matches your hosting domain.
	‚Ä¢	Your Firestore rules should already be deployed.

‚∏ª

Styling & UI
	‚Ä¢	Neon, glassy look using CSS variables and gradients.
	‚Ä¢	Responsive grid-based layout.
	‚Ä¢	Subtle animations for polish.
	‚Ä¢	Admin-only sections are hidden by .admin-only when in readonly mode.
	‚Ä¢	Main content (<main>) is hidden until login (JS toggles display: none/grid based on auth).
	‚Ä¢	Info Modal: a ghost button in header opens a modal with clear, concise tournament rules.

‚∏ª

Known Limitations
	‚Ä¢	Player input expects balanced roles (same number of Attackers/Defenders). The app enforces this to maintain the balanced pairing logic.
	‚Ä¢	Team count must be even; if there‚Äôs an odd pair count, add/remove a player to fix balance.
	‚Ä¢	Currently supports Swiss R1 or Swiss R1+R2 only (by design, for time efficiency).
